//Family Project!
//Create an app that introduces us to not only yourself, but your family as well.
//Create a dashboard screen that shows us your family as a whole.
//Need individual elements that we can tap on that will segue to a detail view about each individual family member.
//Be creative with your design of the app! Personalize so it is your own. Add colors, fonts, pictures, etc.
//Use constraints!
//Create only 2 views. A dashboard view and a detail view. Dynamically populate the detail view dependant on what element is tapped in the dashboard view.

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    }
